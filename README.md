# FJC Token Contract

## Overview

The FJC Token is an ERC20 token with burnable capabilities, built on the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed with a capped maximum supply to prevent inflation. The contract leverages OpenZeppelin's `ERC20Burnable`, `Ownable`, and `AccessControl` contracts to ensure security and manageability.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard**: Fully compliant with the ERC20 standard.
- **Burnable**: Tokens can be burned, reducing the total supply and potentially increasing value.
- **Capped Supply**: The total supply will not exceed 1 billion FJC tokens.
- **Ownership and Access Control**: Enhanced security features that restrict who can perform certain actions within the contract.
